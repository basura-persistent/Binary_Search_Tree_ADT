# Binary_Search_Tree_ADT
- Using C++ I wrote  recursive and iterative solutions to ADT operations on a Binary Search Tree such as Find and Insert. -Used  a linked-list data structure to insert nodes while maintaining the value property of a Binary Search Tree -The use of this data structure allowed us to efficiently complete Insert and Find operations in a O(Log n) complexity
